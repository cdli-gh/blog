## Learning and Success
I have learnt following :
- Impacts of Quantitative survey.
- No JS design implentation.
- Accessible design
- Edge cases scenarios
- SASS.
- WCAG 2.1 guildelines.


## Difficulties
I faced some difficulties while working on NO Javascript designs also, I wasn't familiar with audience, so initially it was very difficult for me to empathize but finally with weekly held design meetings and interviews helped me to overcome them.

## Plan update
I am planning to contribute more in CDLI after the GSoC as well, by implementing the designs which are not implemented yet. Also I am documenting the every design decisions so future contributors can refer them.
