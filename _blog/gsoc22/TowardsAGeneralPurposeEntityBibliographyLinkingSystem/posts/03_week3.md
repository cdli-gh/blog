## Week Summary

This week, we will transition into data cleaning.

TODO 1: Our publications table consists of a lot of redundant publications, since it is a direct copy from the old ``artifacts`` database.

The task here would be to run automatic python scripts 

TODO 2: Get data on connecting artifacts to proveniences

Rune gave me some data about publications and proveniences. I tried linking their project's publications with the CDLI ones, but could not match those.
Maybe I can consider adding the publications Rune gave to the publications?
