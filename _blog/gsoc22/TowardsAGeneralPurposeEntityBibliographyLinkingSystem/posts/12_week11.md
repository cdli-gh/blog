## Week Summary

The scripting issue has been resolved - now the script is able to run in the container. 

Whenever the user submits a PDF file, it will be saved in a temporary directory, and a POST request is sent to the nodejs server. The nodejs server runs a python scripts that parses the PDF file in the temporary directory. The result of the parsing is saved into a temporary csv file.

The cakePHP end then reads this csv and displays the results to the user.

Also, school has started on my side, so I have less availability.
