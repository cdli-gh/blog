## Week Summary

We should get started with single publication file submission at this point. However I am currently kind of stuck
on how we proceed. I don't know how to properly extract the data of a file from its form.

The next steps:

1. Figure out how to extract file from the form. (DONE)

2. Setup a docker container that takes in pdf file and parses it with python scripts. (IN PROGRESS)

3. Make cakePHP application invoke that container and retrieve the result (cURL?)

4. Display the "suggestions" to the user.
