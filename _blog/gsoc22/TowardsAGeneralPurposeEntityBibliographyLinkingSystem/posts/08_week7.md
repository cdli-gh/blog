## Week Summary

Today we'll see what we can do about proveniences that Rune just gave me. I feel like this task could be separated into 2 sides:

1. cakePHP code side

This would require implementing the code to show related publications in proveniences page, and to show related proveniences page in publications page.

2. Data analysis

Simply put, we need data on connections between publications and proveniences. Couldn't just use the "second-hand" links, but we need to use the toolset in ``awca-ocr`` about pdfs to analyze contents of proveniences.
