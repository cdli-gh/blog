## Week Summary

The focus of this week will be to continue adapting the old referencing system to the new one, as well as starting running the publication entry merging script.

TODO 1: Give yourself admin access and take a look at the code that has to do with artifacts_publications

TODO 2: Run the python script on the actual data to see what can be done.
