## Learning and Success
I can confidently add cakephp (a php framework)  as part of the technologies I can use.
cdli framework is a really a large codebase; it was a practical experience and opportunity contributing to the codebase.
I've got some basic concept of docker. Grew in my knowledge of git. 
Cdli codebase is hosted on gitlab(not github). It taught me how to use the gitlab platform.

Quite a good number of students, researchers, etc depend on CDLI for historian and artifacts, cuneiform, resources. It's a priviledge to work on higly valued open source project as this plus being mentored by superiors. 
 
## Difficulties
No much of dificulty. 

## Plan update
I plan to continue extending the project idea and also contributing to other issues, enhancements, features on the framework.
