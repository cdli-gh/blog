|6   	| Saturday  |  2022/09/10	| I had issue passing parameters from route to the add() action of my controller.. It worked but threw some other errors which I mentioned in the meeting but I was able to resolve it by using getParam() method ( $image_id = $this->request->getParam('pass')[0]; ////get the image id ). THis allows me to be able to use the proper add.ctp file to follow up with cakephp route conventions. |
