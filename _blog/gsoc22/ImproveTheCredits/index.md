## Improve the credits: ownership and licencing of digital assets

This project is targeted at updating how digital assetsâ€™ license, ownership
and credits are stored, while considering how they can be displayed in a
more detailed way. The system should be able to manage one or multiple owners, should they be individuals or institutions; manage credits, to one or more individual or institutions and the type of credit.

| 2 | :white_check_mark: | images management | The objectives of this issue are to put in place the infrastructure so displaying the web images and checking access will be done through the images table. This will also require minimal add / edit / delete functionality. A bonus objective is preparing a page that will harvest information about orphan web images so the admin can add them to the images table. |    [#885](https://gitlab.com/cdli/framework/-/issues/885)     |
