## Week Summary

This week included a lot of debugging as usual. I had to first discuss with my mentor a proper data structure which could be implemented with the filters to print the number of hits. After Discussion came the mamoth task of creating the data structure, it required a lot of array manipulation functions and reading of php manual. Finally after making the structure I could pass it to the view file and then I concatenated the filters to print number of hits in parentheses.
