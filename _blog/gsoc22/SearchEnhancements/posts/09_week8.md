## Week Summary

So, I had finally completed the parent-child feature with addition of artifact_types. Now I will be moving onto my next task which was supposed to be adding 
stats to the search page but due to delay in previous task. I had to switch to different task this week that is of Encode Elasticsearch queries using JSON by
replacing the current string concatenation. This task is to increase accessibilty of ES queries individually. So, instead of current concatenated strings, we
need them to be individual arrays which could be merged to get the complete query.
