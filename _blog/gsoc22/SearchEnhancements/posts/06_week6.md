## Week Summary

This week included a feature which was very particular to our website. I had to work on the parent-child relationships between artifacts. These exist in four
tables of the database such as Languages, Materials, genres and Artifact Type. Basically my task was to include the results of a child, grandchild when we 
search  for a parent either in the free search or advance search. This was a particularly elaborated task as it was more artifact related one. One of the
objectives of this task was also to update the filters to show the filters which are children in a specific way such 
as
"parent -> child". Overall it was a very
good learning experience.
