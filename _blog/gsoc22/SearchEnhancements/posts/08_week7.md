## Week Summary

So, my task of search children entities was extended a bit due to more work required on the feature. Most of the objectives were achieved in this week and a
succesful PR was created. The searches were too big for my machine to handle hence it took more than time than anticipated as testing at every step became more
time consuming. This week was a real patience-tester but I am glad I was able to work through it and complete the feature. I had to work through all the aspects
of a search that is using the database, updating the queries. Adding this feature might be the most learning experience.
