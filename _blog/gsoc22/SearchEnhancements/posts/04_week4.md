## Week Summary

New week new objective begins. This week's issue is related to the search filters not being updated after one of the them is being applied. Identifying the 
exact problem was difficult hence I came up with a solution and discussed it's implementation with my mentor. Then I went on to do the testing and created a
PR.I also solved some other existing issues in this PR.
