## Week Summary
This is my first week of 12 weeks. As I had already planned the work I started working on Elasticsearch buckets. At first things seemed to flow easily as I was
able to implement queries but eventually there were problems and delays were made. Thankfully I was able to cover them up by alloting more time. I also reviewed
my first PR during this week it was a great learning experience. Overall it was a great first week for me, learnt about so many new things looking forward to  more of this.
