## Seals Portal

The seals portal aims at displaying all of the resources in the CDLI concerning a seal, aggregated in one place, with important features like viewing image annotations and graphical representation of seals chemistry. The objectives of the project are: Creating the seals portal which lists different CDLI seals as groups i.e. physical, composite, sealings, and all cdli seals for a better user experience. It shows a list of best-attested composite seals along with an image and description. It presents a table containing seals and impressed tablets by period, here the users can view seals grouped by period (name and duration). The seals' single view will display the seal image, a graphical way to present seals' chemical information; this graph can be viewed in a bar chart, pie chart, line chart and can be converted to tabular format. The sealsâ€™ single view includes accordions to display physical information, inscription, identifiers, provenience, Composites, Inscriptions, and Chemical information. It also displays Image annotations. This project will also have a standalone converter tool for converting annotations from COCO format to w3c.json format. There will be a bulk update interface to upload annotations to the database the user can upload the annotations in w3c.json or COCO format.
