## Week Summary

This Week, I will be focusing on creating required model files for `image_annotations` and `seals_portal`.The image_annotations will be filled with dummy data for now, which will be updated once I get the data from Lara. 

I will be creating a test site to 
1. Demonstrate the working for image_annotations using ` OpenSeadragon Annotorious ` plugin
2. Demonstrate working of graphs in seal single view.
