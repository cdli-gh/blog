## Week Summary

This week I will be working on creating the seal single view.
It includes the following sub-tasks
1. Implementation of a PHP library for graphical representation of chemical information of seals.
2. A feature to view only top n elements (based on weight)
3. A switch to convert the graph into a table view.
4. Graphical visualisation of element weight in that seal in the form of line chart, and bar graph

Additionally, I would be installing iconv extension.
