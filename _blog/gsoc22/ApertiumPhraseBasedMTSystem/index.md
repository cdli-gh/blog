## Apertium - Phrase-based MT system
The previously developed Machine Translation systems for Sumerian face sparsity issues because of their low-resource. The advanced translation techniques work better with the higher availability of data, whereas for low-resource languages, Rule Based/Symbolic Machine translation is a good alternative which can be used to improvise the accuracy. The objective is to build a sumerian-english machine translation system using one of the widely used machine translation platforms Apertium.
