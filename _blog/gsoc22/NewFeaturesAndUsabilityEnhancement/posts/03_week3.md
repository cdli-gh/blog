## Week Summary

This is the third week of the 12 weeks of my project. I added the retired section to the artifact single edit form and also updated my PR with the queries to update the db along with the tests to be performed to review the PR. It looks like I am just a bit ahead of schedule so I will start with the documentation in this week itself.
