## Week Summary

This is the first week for the Entity Export feature. I was having some trouble understanding the working of the existing export functionlaity but my doubts were cleared in the meet with Lars. After this I'm faced with a blocker where the link for export is not working in a particular way, and Lars is helping me out with that. I figured that till then I will start with some basic content for the documentation of this feature. So I wrote the user documentation instead of just waiting around.
