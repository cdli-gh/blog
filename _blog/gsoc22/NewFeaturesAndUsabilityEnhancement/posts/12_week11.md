## Week Summary

This is the 11th and the second last week of my project. In the last 2 weeks I will be working on the export of publication index and single view pages. The bulk updates task is taking too long to complete, and hence I am lagging behind in the bulk update task. Now, I will have to do both the tasks simultaneously.
