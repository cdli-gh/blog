## Week Summary

This is the final week of my project! I'm very excited about finally finishing all of my work! 
The publications export pr was merged on Tuesday! Now only the Bulk Update pr is left. After someone tests by branch I can do further troubleshooting. I was quite afraid of this pr ever since I made the proposal and it looks like my fear is justified. This pr is still not merged but the last one is!
By the end of this week, I felt that the amount of work left is too much to do in 2 days and also I have exams coming for the next 2 weeks; so my project was extended by 3 weeks. After this week I will resume working after 18th, or do small amounts of work in between if I find the time.
