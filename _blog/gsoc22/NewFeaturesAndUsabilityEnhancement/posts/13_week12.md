## Week Summary

This is the final week of my project! I'm very excited about finally finishing all of my work! 
The publications export pr was merged on Tuesday! Now only the Bulk Update pr is left. After someone tests by branch I can do further troubleshooting. I was quite afraid of this pr ever since I made the proposal and it looks like my fear is justified. This pr is still not merged but the last one is!
